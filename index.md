# Have your voice heard NOW

Between now and November 6, 2018, let's talk about voting, preparing to vote, helping other prepare to vote, and reminding each other that it is coming up very soon. Outside of the social and real life conversations, let's create some signs inviting others to vote with us. Here's your call to action:

1. Print out this sign and put it in a place where many people can see it. [PNG](http://votenov.com/assets/votenov-700.png)
2. [Download this SVG](http://votenov.com/assets/voteNov-stencil.svg) and laser cut it and produce a lot of signs (instructions soon to come!)
3. Share what you make with others!! Put them on in your front yard, in your car, at the local coffee shop, in Walmart, everywhere. Remind EVERYONE of the day we vote.

More to come!

PS, if you make a sign, snap a shot and be sure to tag VoteNov in it! (twitter: [VoteNov](https://twitter.com/VoteNov) instagram: [VoteNove](https://instagram.com/VoteNove) )

## Voter primaries are here!

Many have passed, but there are plenty more coming per state. Go here and out if you have a voting / volunteering opportunity coming up.

- [2018 Primaries Calendar](http://votenov.com/2018-primaries).

## Follow VoteNov socially.

Because this is currently being run by a single person, not much time will be dedicated to updating Twitter and or Instagram yet. When we have more people in place, we will make sure to get both major and minor messages out there.

## The VoteNov shop.

The [VoteNov Shop](http://shop.votenov.com/) is open for business! Get you PRE-VOTING stickers and buttons.

By showing off stickers, buttons, signs, bumper stickers, and maybe even fake tattoos, we will be sellings goods to help support your loud voice that shouts, “VOTE!” If you have any additional suggestions, please let us know.

## Call for designers.

The VoteNov design was purposely created as a blueprint in order to allow other individuals reimagine how the graphic should look. As a 4 letter by 4 letter grid, font, background, and the top four letter words waiting to be re-styled to fit your neighborhood, your crew, or a cause that is close to you. If you are interested in participating, please email us at <votenovember@gmail.com>.

## Call for state page maintainers.

We are in the process of creating a state markdown template where a state local OR better yet, a group of locals that can gather all relevant voting information and share it out. We are not looking for partisan politics here, we are just looking to get people the most correct information in order to vote and support the vote. If you are intersted, please contact us at <votenovember@gmail.com>.

## Register to vote.

If you are unsure of how to register to vote OR want to figure out where your polling place might be, here are some links that can help you start. If you have additional questions, please follow [VoteNov](https://twitter.com/VoteNov) on Twitter and DM us with your thoughts.

## Who is behind this?
@Shelton, and @TheEmpathyLab are currently steering this boat at the moment. So that we don't bring personal bias into this README, there is plenty more about the two elsewhere. Go check him and the Lab out.
