## Prepare to be heard.

We are listening, building, and working on a way to improve the voter turnout for 2018. More details to come. In the meanwhile, follow us on the following social networks to stay in touch.

## The VoteNov Shop.

A shop is being constructed in order to help people spread the silent word. Through stickers, buttons, signs, bumper stickers, and maybe even fake tattoos, we will be sellings goods to help support your loud voice that shouts, "VOTE!" Shop soon to open. If you are interested in getting some stickers, contact us <votenovember@gmail.com>.

## Call for Designers.

The VoteNov design was purposely created as a blueprint in order to allow other individuals reimagine how the graphic should look. As a 4 letter by 4 letter grid, font, background, and the top four letter words waiting to be re-styled to fit your neighborhood, your crew, or a cause that is close to you. If you are interested in participating, please email us at <votenovember@gmail.com>.
